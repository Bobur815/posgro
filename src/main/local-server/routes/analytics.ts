/**
 * The analytics page.
 *
 * A direct port of `AnalyticsService.getAnalyticsData()` — the same seven queries, translated
 * from PostgreSQL to the SQLite dialect. The Electron `analytics:getData` IPC handler runs
 * something similar for the POS's own analytics screen, but it is not a faithful copy of this
 * endpoint (no `productRanking`, `topProducts` sorted by quantity instead of revenue, and a
 * `LIMIT 10` on the category breakdowns), so it is not reused here.
 *
 * `rankProducts()` is imported from the server module rather than reimplemented: it is pure,
 * already unit-tested, and the ordering rules around missing cost prices are subtle enough that
 * a second copy would drift.
 *
 * Timezone: the server buckets hours at a hardcoded UTC+5 and days at plain UTC — inconsistent
 * with itself. Here both use the terminal's own local time, which for a shop in Uzbekistan is
 * UTC+5 with no DST. That makes the day and hour buckets agree with each other and with the
 * till's own reports, which is what the shopkeeper is comparing against.
