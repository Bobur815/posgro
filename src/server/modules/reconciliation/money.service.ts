 *
 * A credit sale removes goods exactly like a cash sale, so a debt is already inside "sales" in
 * the goods equation; it must not be subtracted there. Debt only explains why the drawer is
 * smaller than sales, which is this module's job alone.
 *
 * The drawer side comes from `Smena` rows mirrored up by the terminals at shift close. Those
 * carry terminal-computed totals rather than figures recomputed here, because a return is a
 * hard-deleted Sale on this side — after one, the server can no longer reconstruct what a shift
 * actually took in. See the note on the `Smena` model.
 *
 * A period with no synced shifts still reports the expected side and says so via `limitation`,
 * rather than showing a zero variance that was never computed.
